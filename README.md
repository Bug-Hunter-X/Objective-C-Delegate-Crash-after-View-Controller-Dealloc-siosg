This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug related to memory management and delegates.  The bug occurs when a view controller sets itself as the delegate of another object and deallocates before the other object finishes using the delegate.  This leads to a crash because the other object sends messages to a deallocated object. The solution uses weak references to fix this.
